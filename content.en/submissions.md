2024-02-29: Notification of acceptance / rejection

2024-04-05: Conference!

### Details

The Technical AI Safety Conference will bring together specialists in the field of technical safety to share their research and benefit from each others’ expertise. We want our attendees to involve themselves in cutting-edge conversations throughout the conference with networking opportunities with the brightest minds in AI Safety.
We seek to launch this forum for academics, researchers and professionals who are doing technical work in these or adjacent fields:

* Mechanistic interpretability
* Scalable oversight
* Causal incentive analysis
* Agent foundations
* Singular learning theory
* Argumentation
* Emergent agentic phenomena
* Thermodynamic / statistical-mechanical analyses of computational systems

We invite the submission of research papers, or extended abstracts, that deal with related topics. We particularly encourage submissions from researchers in the ALIFE community who would not otherwise have considered submitting to TAIS 2024.

We have some (limited) funding to cover travel and accommodation for authors of accepted presentations.

Please send your submissions to [blaine@aisafety.tokyo](mailto:someone@aisafety.tokyo).

### About TAIS 2024

The Technical AI Safety Conference will bring together specialists in the field of AI and technical safety to share their research and benefit from each othersâ€™ expertise. We want our attendees to involve themselves in cutting-edge conversations throughout the conference with access to networking opportunities with the brightest minds in AI Safety.

TAIS 2024, being hosted in Tokyo, will allow access to Japanese research and specialists (singular learning theory, collective / emergent behavior, artificial life and consciousness), who are often overlooked outside of Japan. We want to help people connect to the Japanese wellpool of information, and make connections with other individuals to share ideas and leap forward into greater collaborative understanding.

TAIS 2024 is sponsored by [Noeon Research](https://noeon.ai).
